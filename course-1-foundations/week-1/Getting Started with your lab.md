## This course leverages CodePen and the Duke Learn to Program enviornment for assignments. This Lab Sandbox can best be used to help provide a practice environment and is an alternative to CodePen. We still highly recommend that you leverage the Duke Learn to Program enviornment when your instructor recommends using the Duke to Learn Programminng environment instead (http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com) Thanks!"

#  The following steps need to be taken to complete the Lab on the Sandbox environment

## How can I view my HTML files?

### Viewing your lab files with VSCode's live server & browser preview

1. Click on the "Go Live" icon at the bottom-right of your lab environment alongside the notification (bell) icon.
2. You should see the server starting message - "Server is Started at port : 5500"
3. Click on the Browser Preview Icon from the bottom of the lefthand menu of the lab environment. This is the icon on that looks like a browser window. 
4. A browser preview window should open for you and on the address bar type the URL - localhost:5500/
5. You should see all your lab files in the browser preview window.

### Viewing your lab files within VSCode's browser preview

1. Right-click on the HTML file you want to preview and copy the RELATIVE PATH.
2. Click on the Browser Preview Icon from the left menu of the lab environment.
3. A browser preview window should open for you and on the address bar type the URL - localhost:8000/lab/<YOUR_RELATIVE_PATH>
4. Your file content will display.

### Highly Recommended: Viewing your files in a separate browser tab for full browser dev tools access (helpful for debugging)):

 You'll be able to preview your web content using the following path - https:// lab id>.labs.coursera.org/lab/<YOUR_RELATIVE_FILE_PATH (in a new browser tab for full browser dev tools access).
 
 Input the following "https:// lab id>.labs.coursera.org/lab/<YOUR_RELATIVE_FILE_PATH" in your URL browser toolbar, replacing <your lab id> with the value you see from the top Lab iframe "Help" icon.

<!-- General Instructions -->

### Making External Calls and Pulling in Depdendency Files:
Please note that this sandbox environment has limited access to the internet, so most external sites cannot be accessed. To avoid errors, 
we recommend uploading any source CSS, JS, or other file assets needed for your work directly to this lab environment. 
You can upload files by dragging and dropping them from your local computer into your VSCode lab.

### Replace any "missing code" and "write your code here" comments with your code which you want to run inside that exercise function

# How to add necessary files and links in the code:
   >> Create a seperate css file with a .css extention.
   >> Link it to html using <link rel="stylesheet" href="FILENAME.css"> in the head tag of the HTML file.
   >> Create a seperate JS file with a .js extention.
   >> Link it to html using  <link rel="stylesheet" href="FILENAME.js"> in the head tag of the HTML file.

<!-- Simple Image library -->
###### SIMPLE IMAGE LIBRARY ######

# A replica of SimpleImage library has been created and added in the lab environment named SimpleImage.js. This library is used in the Duke university labs (as tagged URL in the HTML files).

## You can find the library online, it has been replicated from the below mentioned URL, if in case you want to go through it.
        http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course1/common/js/image/SimpleImage.js

<!-- Steps to include the SimpleImage.js in index.html -->

# You will need to use the <script src="SimpleImage.js"></script> tag in the HEAD Tag of the HTML file to tell your program where to find the Simple Image library in this lab environment. 

# NOTE: If you are using the images provided to you make sure to add "Images/FILENAME.<image file extension>"
